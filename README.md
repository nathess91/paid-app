# Paid App

## Product Vision
The Paid App was created with the intention of being the first finance-managing app that focuses on suggesting the best way to pay down a user's debt as fast as possible. It does this by using custom algorithms that look at a range of factors including:

- current account balance
- current APR
- promo APR expiration dates
- the user's personal expenses and where you have the most financial flexibility
- due dates
- the user preference on highest bill importance
- type of bill (monthly household requirements, such as rent & electrical vs. recurring debt payments, many of which may be optional beyond the minimum amount due)

Additionally, users can filter the bills on their dashboard by upcoming, previously paid, general, and debt. Each bill can be edited within the dashboard to maintain the integrity of the single page app.
